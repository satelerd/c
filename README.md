# If I can train gpt2 in c, I can claim to `kinda` understand c.

#### This repository contains all the resources and code developed through a tailored curriculum designed in conversation with Chat[GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-axPOXP3eC-gpt-2-c-guide).

## Curriculum
The curriculum is structured to cover both fundamental and advanced concepts necessary for mastering C, particularly in the context of implementing and training neural networks. Each chapter of the curriculum corresponds to a specific topic, with corresponding code examples and exercises stored in dedicated folders within this repository.
